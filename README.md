## CoinFX Front End Coding Assignment

Using the Figma diagram [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Zfxmz6iuzI6rBLV4Qo36Kc/CBDC-Exchange?node-id=0%3A1), please construct the appropriate views using React. 

Styling, tests, and state managment libraries are choices made by the assignee. For example, we use (State Management -> React, Styling -> styled-components/Material UI, tests -> Mocha )

Please provide a README going over the architecture, design tradeoffs, and instructions to run the new site. 

Completed submissions are assumed to be code complete.

Good Luck!
